# Computer-Graphics

We will take a modular approach to build an in-browser graphics engine, which we will use to create a final project. We will work primarily in JavaScript and GLSL, with the help of WebGL (a JavaScript API for rendering graphics on the HTML canvas). In the process we will cover the underlying mathematics, which will consist primarily of geometric principles and linear transformations necessary for conversions between local space, world space, and view space as well as lighting, texturing, reflection, refraction, and other visual effects.
