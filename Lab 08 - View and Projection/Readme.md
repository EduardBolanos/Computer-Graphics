1. Download [cameraDemo.zip](https://github.com/EduardBolanos/Computer-Graphics/tree/master/OriginalLabs)
2. Complete the two "TODO"s in core/matrix.js (the view and projection matrices).
3. Complete all "TODO"s in cameras/perspectiveCamera.js
4. You should be able to run the demo and see the same display that was in the lighting demo; you should be able to move the camera with:
    -   W: Forward
    -   A: Left
    -   S: Back
    -   D: Right
    -   Q: Down(local)
    -   E: Up(local)
    -   Left Arrow Key: Look Left
    -   Right Arrow Key: Look Right
    -   Down Arrow Key: Look Down
    -   Up Arrow Key: Look Up
    -   You do ot need to implement this control scheme; it is already set up
    -   Feel free to edit the control scheme by editing cameras/fpsCamera.js
5. Optional: complete the orthographic matrix in core/matrix, and implement an orthographic camera which mimics the perspective camera but with an orthographic projection
