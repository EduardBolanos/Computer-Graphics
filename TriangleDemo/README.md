# Lab 01: Drawing Triangles

1.  Read the code with extensive comments to understand how to draw a single triangle on an HTML canvas using WebGL

2. Modify this example to draw a picture or write out a message in triangles.
    1. Note that multiple triangles can be drawn at once; just put all of the corners' positions in one positions array, and all of     the colors in one color array. You do not need to create separate position arrays for each triangle as done in the demo.
