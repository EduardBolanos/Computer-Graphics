1.  Get the Vector, Quaternion, Matrix and Transform class skeleton scripts from HW 1.
2.  Complete the following methods:
    -   Vector.constructor
    -   Vector.set
    -   Vector.add
    -   Vector.subtract
    -   Vector.scale
    -   Vector.inverse
    -   Vector.magnitude
    -   Vector.normalize
    -   Vector.toString
    -   Vector.toArray
    -   Vector.sum
    -   Vector.dot
    -   Vector.cross
    -   Matrix.identity
    -   Matrix.translation
    -   Matrix.scale
    -   Matrix.mul
    -   Matrix.prod
3.  Use the Lab 2 test script (provided in the HW 1 download) to ensure everything is working as intended.
4. Start after completeing the methods above and testing.
5. Complete the following methods:
    -   Quaternion.constructor
    -   Quaternion.set
    -   Quaternion.inverse
    -   Quaternion.renormalize
    -   Quaternion.compose
    -   Quaternion.composition
    -   Quaternion.applyRotation
    -   Quaternion.localCompose
    -   Quaternion.toString
    -   Quaternion.fromVector
    -   Vector.fromQuaternion
    -   Vector.rotate
    -   Matrix.rotation
6. Use the Lab 3 test script to ensure everything is working as intended.
7.  Complete the Vector, Quaternion, and Matrix classes (located in the "class skeletons" folder).
8.  Complete the Transform class.
9.  Use the homework 1 test script in the test folder to ensure everything is working as intended.
    -   Create an html script which includes all four class scripts and the test script.
    -   Run this html (or host a server, if preferred).
